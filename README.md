MEAN Stack

**Architecture**

1. **Compare and Contrast Frontend Development:** Express HTML, while traditional, involves server-side rendering with a more linear structure, whereas the single-page application (SPA) uses frameworks like Angular or React, enabling dynamic content updates without full-page reloads. Express HTML often requires separate files for HTML, CSS, and JS, whereas SPAs encapsulate these within components.
  
2. **Backend's Choice of MongoDB:** The NoSQL MongoDB database is favored for its flexibility in handling unstructured data, scalability, and ease of horizontal scaling, aligning well with the nature of modern web applications that often deal with varying data structures and evolving schemas.

**Functionality**

1. **JSON and its Role in Full Stack Development:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format, distinct from JavaScript, that acts as a common language between frontend and backend. It facilitates seamless data exchange, enabling the backend to respond to frontend requests in a format easily interpretable by JavaScript.

2. **Refactoring and Reusable UI Components:** Refactoring code in the full stack process often involved optimizing code for better performance or readability. Reusable UI components streamlined development, enhancing consistency across the application, reducing redundancy, and enabling quicker development cycles.

**Testing**

1. **API Testing and Security:** API testing involves verifying endpoints for various request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to ensure proper functionality. Testing with added security layers involves validating authentication, authorization mechanisms, and handling edge cases, like input sanitization, to prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

**Reflection**
